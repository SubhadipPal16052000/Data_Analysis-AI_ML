# InternPe Data_Analysis-AI_ML
## Introduction

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to **Detection of Breast Cancer** based on diagnostic measurements. Early and accurate detection of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. This analysis uses machine learning techniques to assist in this critical diagnostic process.

The primary goal is to develop a robust classification model that can accurately distinguish between benign and malignant tumours, thereby offering a valuable tool for medical professionals.
## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset** 
* **Source:** Provided by Internpe (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UXH9SKM4LA04lI0QnoktaD-jGyJL7w1j?usp=sharing)
* **Description:** This dataset contains 569 instances, 33 numeric features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the id, diagnosis, radius_mean, texture_mean,  perimeter_mean, area_mean,smoothness_mean, compactness_mean,  concavity_mean, concave points_mean, texture_worst, perimeter_worst, area_worst, smoothness_worst,compactness_worst, concavity_worst, concave points_worst, symmetry_worst,  fractal_dimension_worst, Unnamed: 32  . The target variable is `diagnosis`, indicating whether the tumor is `M` (Malignant) or `B` (Benign).
